The individual's interest in the privacy of their data has grown at the same pace that this data is used by the industry to generate and obtain value from this information. Recently, companies have realized this interest in privacy and seek to use techniques to obtain information from data without breaches and breaches of privacy and demonstrate this to their customers. Furthermore, the great nations around the world have developed mechanisms, through law, to defend the privacy and security of its citizens' data.",

    "problemas-descricao": "Due to the pandemic, the Department of Health of Ceará has published a list of results of the Covid-19 exams of people from Ceará, duly anonymized, without the name and CPF of the patient. Parallel to this, the Electoral Court of Ceará published the list of candidates for councilors in the State's municipalities in the last election. A simple association between the two lists allowed the re-identification of 72% of the candidates elected for the Fortaleza election. Thus, sensitive information from the candidates, such as exam results and declared comorbidities, were discovered.",
    "problemas-descricao1": "A hospital in the Federal District had to compensate a family victim of a scam for breach of confidentiality. A person claiming to be an employee of the Hospital contacted the hospitalized patient's son, claiming the need for an extra exam and asked to transfer the corresponding amount. Supposedly, the criminals had access to the patient's relative's number through the hospital's records, configuring a failure in the provision of the service. Data privacy in hospitals is essential, due to the existence of sensitive data."
